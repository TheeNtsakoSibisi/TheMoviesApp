# TheMoviesApp
Showcase content from ​The Movie Database API
(​https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction​).
# The Assessment
Upon receiving this assessment, I had to rewrite the requirements down on a piece of paper and listed the requirements according to priority.
My list was something like this:
1. Get API key from TMDB.
2. Design the layout according to assessment specs.
3. Get the API Url, Image path and do the search function.
4. Do the Contact Us page.
5. Do the Login page.

# The Approach
The approach to my assessment is a mix of PHP and NodeJS.
PHP was used for the Contact page and the Login page. Though I must admit that I couldn't complete the login page in time :(.
I used the app.js file for the API call annd rendered the movie image and title along with the release date. 

I faced challenges when I had to paginate the layout. Reading through the documentation, I saw that it only showed 20 results per API call. So I struggled in getting more API calls for page 2 and so forth.

# The Setup
I made use of Github Pages to run and test the app. I used Github as my cloud-based source code management or version control system. Files have been uploaded and you can run the app here: https://theentsakosibisi.github.io/TheMoviesApp.github.io/
